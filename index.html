    <p>This is a paragraph. It is corn flower blue.</p>
    </div>

         <p class= "one"> Lately I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would
Back in my head we were kissing
I thought things were going alright
With a sign on my back saying kick me
Reality ruined my life
Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got twenty seven tattoos
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would
Would he please you
Would he kiss you
Would he treat you like I would
Would he touch you
Would he need you
Would he love you like I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would
Would he please you
Would he kiss you
Would he treat you like I would
Would he touch you
Would he need you
Would he love you like I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E
Well if it was me then
I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
Baby you should know that I would
I would, I would yeah</p>
